The Carbon Aware SDK at its core sits firmly in the **Tooling** pillar, and also supports the other pillars, providing **Knowledge** through emissions data to inform change, and being core enabler for the **Tech Culture** for building carbon aware software.\\n\\nCompanies including UBS and Vestas have already deployed the Carbon Aware SDK to build greener software, and you can too!\\n\\n_Published in feb 2024 based on latest updates to the readme.md_"}]}}')}}]);
