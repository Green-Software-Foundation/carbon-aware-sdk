# Setting up and using the Carbon Aware SDK

This guide will provide you with knowledge and examples necessary to use the
SDK, either as a CLI, by directly calling the Web API endpoints or by using
generated libraries for your language of choice!

- [using the cli](#using-the-cli)
- [using the web api](#using-the-web-api)


## Using the CLI

### Setting up the CLI

Prerequisites:

- .NET Core 8.0
- Alternatively:
  - Docker
  - VSCode (it is recommended to work in a Dev Container)
  - Remote Containers extension for VSCode:
    [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

The CLI can either be run locally with `dotnet` or in a container, e.g. using
VSCode Remote Containers (Dev Container). To run locally:

1. Make sure you have the repository cloned:
   [https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git)
2. `git clone https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git`
3. Change directory to: `cd carbon-aware-sdk/src/CarbonAware.CLI/src`
4. If you have a WattTime account registered (or other data source) - you will
   need to configure the application to use them. By default the SDK will use a
   pre-generated JSON file with random data. This random data is meant to make
   it easier to get started with the SDK and doesn't represent actual Carbon
   data. To configure the application, you will need to set up specific
   environment variables or modify `appsettings.json` inside of
   `src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src` directory. Detailed information on configuration
   can be found in the [overview.md](overview/overview.md) file.

   Otherwise, you can follow an example configuration below (export these
   environment variables in the Terminal):

   ```bash
   export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__Type="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__username="<YOUR_WATTTIME_USERNAME>"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__password="<YOUR_WATTTIME_PASSWORD>"
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__Type="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APITokenHeader="auth-token"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APIToken="<YOUR_ELECTRICITYMAPS_TOKEN>"
   ```


1. Run the CLI using `dotnet run`

The CLI will ask you to at minimum provide a `--location (-l)` parameter.

### Calling the SDK via CLI

To run the CLI, simply call `dotnet run` and provide it with any parameters. If
you fail to pass any parameters, a help screen will be printed out with possible
parameters and short explanations.

To get a list of all locations supported, you can use the Locations API,
referenced in `src/CarbonAware.CLI/src/Commands/Location`
and the command `.\caw locations`. Note that you have to configure `LocationDataSourcesConfiguration`
into `appsettings.json` before running the command.

Expected output:

```JSON
{
  "eastus": {
    "Latitude": 37.3719,
    "Longitude": -79.8164,
    "Name": "eastus"
  },
  ...
  "switzerlandnorth":{
    "Latitude": 47.451542,
    "Longitude": 8.564572,
    "Name": "switzerlandnorth"
  },
  ...
}
```

For example, to get emissions in the `eastus` and `uksouth` region between
`2022-08-23 at 11:15am` and `2022-08-23 at 11:20am`, run:
`dotnet run emissions -l eastus,uksouth -s 2022-08-23T11:15 -e 2022-08-23T11:20`

Expected output:

```JSON
[
  {
    "Location": "PJM_ROANOKE",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:20:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 567.44405487,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "PJM_ROANOKE",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:15:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 564.72250065,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "PJM_ROANOKE",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:10:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 564.72250065,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:20:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 422.74808884000004,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:15:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 422.74808884000004,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:10:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 422.74808884000004,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  }
]
```

To get the best time and location from a list of locations and a specified time
window, use the `--best` flag. E.g. to get the best time and location in a 24
hour window on the 23rd of August in the regions: `eastus`, `westus`,
`westus3`,`uksouth`, run the command:

```bash
dotnet run emissions -l eastus,westus,westus3,uksouth -s 2022-08-23T00:00 -e 2022-08-23T23:59 --best
```

Expected output:

```JSON
[
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T08:50:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 384.64632976,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  }
]
```

## Using the Web API

### Setting up the Web API

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop/CLI
- VSCode (it is recommended to work in a Dev Container)
- Remote Containers extension for VSCode:
  [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

First we need to set up the GitHub repository
([https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git)):

1. `git clone https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git`
2. Change directory into the repository: `cd carbon-aware-sdk`
3. Open VSCode: `code .`
4. Open VSCode Command Palette: (Linux/Windows: `ctrl + shift + P`, MacOS:
   `cmd + shift + P`), and run the command:
   - `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`
5. If you have a WattTime account registered (or other data source) - you will
   need to configure the application to use them. By default the SDK will use a
   pre-generated JSON file with random data. To configure the application, you
   will need to set up specific environment variables or modify
   `appsettings.json` inside of `src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src` directory. Detailed
   information on configuration can be found in the [overview.md](overview/overview.md)
   file.

   Otherwise, you can follow an example configuration below (export these
   environment variables in the Terminal):

   ```bash
   export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__Type="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__username="<YOUR_WATTTIME_USERNAME>"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__password="<YOUR_WATTTIME_PASSWORD>"
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__Type="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APITokenHeader="auth-token"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APIToken="<YOUR_ELECTRICITYMAPS_TOKEN>"
   ```


6. In the VSCode Terminal:
7. Change directory to: `cd src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src`
8. And run the application using: `dotnet run`
9. By default, it will be hosted on `localhost:5073`

### Calling the Web API via command line

Prerequisites:

- `curl` or other tool that allows making HTTP requests (e.g. `wget`)
- Recommended: `jq` for parsing JSON output: [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

With the API running on `localhost:5073`, we can make HTTP requests to its
endpoints, full endpoint description can be found here:
[https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src/README.md](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src/README.md)

To get a list of all locations supported, you can use the Locations API endpoint
`/locations` referenced in
`src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src/Controllers/LocationsController.cs`.
Note that you have to configure `LocationDataSourcesConfiguration`
into `appsettings.json` before launching WebAPI, otherwise WebAPI returns
HTTP 204 (No Content).

Expected Output:

```JSON
{
  "eastus": {
    "Latitude": 37.3719,
    "Longitude": -79.8164,
    "Name": "eastus"
  },
  ...
  "switzerlandnorth":{
    "Latitude": 47.451542,
    "Longitude": 8.564572,
    "Name": "switzerlandnorth"
  }
}
```


#### Calling the `/emissions/bylocation` endpoint

In console, we can run the below command, to request data for a single location
in a particular timeframe:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5073/emissions/bylocation?location=westus&time=2022-08-23T14%3A00&toTime=2022-08-23T14%3A30" | jq
```

Note that region names in this example (e.g. `westus`) are defined in
[azure-regions.json](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/data/location-sources/azure-regions.json).
AWS region is also available in [aws-regions.json](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/data/data-files/aws-regions.json).

You can omit the `| jq` to get the JSON data raw and unparsed. This is a request
for data in the `westus` region from the date `2022-08-23 at 14:00` to
`2022-08-23 at 14:30`. (Note: semicolons `:` are encoded as `%3A` in URLs).

The sample data output should be:

```JSON
[
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:30:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.07741416000005,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:25:00+00:00",
    "rating": 438.62382179,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:20:00+00:00",
    "rating": 438.62382179,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:15:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.53100653,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:10:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.98459890000004,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:05:00+00:00",
    "rating": 456.31392422000005,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:00:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.98459890000004,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T13:55:00+00:00",
    "rating": 445.42770734000004,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  }
]
```

#### Calling the `/emissions/bylocations/best` endpoint

This endpoint, unlike the previous one, accepts a list of locations and outputs
a single time and location with the LOWEST Carbon Intensity index.

In console, we can run the below command:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5073/emissions/bylocations/best?location=westus&location=eastus&location=westus3&time=2022-08-23T00%3A00&toTime=2022-08-23T23%3A59" | jq
```

You can omit the `| jq` to get the JSON data raw and unparsed. This is a request
for the best location and time out of the locations: `westus`, `eastus`,
`westus3` in the time window from `2022-08-23 at 00:00` to `2022-08-23 at 23:59`

The sample data output should be:

```JSON
{
  "location": "AZPS",
  "time": "2022-08-23T08:05:00+00:00",
  "rating": 398.70769323,
  "duration": "00:05:00"
}
```

### Calling the Web API via client libraries

The SDK can work with libraries for up to 50 languages generated with the
[Open API Generator (Swagger)](https://openapi-generator.tech/). This guide will
provide a tutorial to generating clients for java, Python, JavaScript, .NET and
GoLang. There is also a walkthrough of an example Python script interacting with
the SDK.

#### Client generation

Prerequisites:

- Docker
- Web API running (locally or hosted online)
- (Optionally) `openapi-generator-cli`

The clients can be generated either by hand with the openapi-generator CLI, or
by running shell scripts which also call these generators. The easiest way to
generate them after using the Web API, is to do it Terminal **while** the Web
API is running.

1. In Terminal: Change into directory `carbon-aware-sdk/src/clients`
2. Run the client generation script, passing the API URL (omitting the initial
   `http://`): `./docker-generate-clients.sh host.docker.internal:5073`
   - If your API is available at a different URL/Port, replace
     `host.docker.internal:5073` with that url.
3. You should now see multiple generated clients in that directory (check with
   `ls`)

There is an alternative script for generating the tests - `generate-clients.sh`
which can be ran if you have the `openapi-generator-cli` installed locally.

#### Python Client installation + example usage

After generating the clients, we can now install them. Most generated clients
(with OpenAPI) should have a `README` file containing instructions on
installation and example usage.

1. Change directory to `cd carbon-aware-sdk/src/clients/python`. This is the
   generated Python client
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install the Python client library using
   [`setuptools`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)):
   `python setup.py install --user`
4. The library is now successfully installed!

There should be an example script in the `README` file, but this guide suggests
trying the following example first:

```Python
import time
import openapi_client
from pprint import pprint
from openapi_client.api import carbon_aware_api
from openapi_client.model.emissions_data import EmissionsData
from  dateutil.parser import parse
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://localhost
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
        host = "http://localhost:5073"
)
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = carbon_aware_api.CarbonAwareApi(api_client)
    location = "westus" # str |  (optional)
    time = parse('2022-07-22T10:30:00.00Z') # datetime |  (optional)
    to_time = parse('2022-07-22T11:00:00.00Z') # datetime |  (optional)
    duration_minutes = 0 # int |  (optional) (default to 0)
    try:
        api_response = api_instance.get_emissions_data_for_location_by_time(location=location, time=time, to_time=to_time, duration_minutes=duration_minutes)
        pprint(api_response)
    except openapi_client.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling CarbonAwareApi->emissions_bylocation_get: %s\n" % e)
```

Here, we import the `openapi_client` along with other modules generated by the
API. We create a default configuration pointing to Web API at `localhost:5073`,
change it to a different URL if your API is deployed at a different URL/port.
This line of code:

```Python
        api_response = api_instance.get_emissions_data_for_location_by_time(location=location, time=time, to_time=to_time, duration_minutes=duration_minutes)
```

Calls the Python Client to send a request to the Carbon Aware SDK Web API, for
the `/emissions/bylocation` endpoint, similarly to what's shown above, when
polling the API directly with HTTP requests. This is an example request for the
`westus` region, in the time window from `2022-07-22 at 10:30am` to
`2022-07-22 at 11:00am`.
