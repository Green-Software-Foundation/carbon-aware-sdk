# Carbon Aware WebApi

The Carbon Aware SDK provides an API to get the carbon intensity for a
given location and time period. The values reported in the Green Software
Foundation's specification for carbon intensity (Grams per Kilowatt
Hour).

**_Highly Recommended_** - This user interface is best for when you can change
the code, and deploy separately. This also allows you to manage the Carbon Aware
logic independently of the system using it.

The WebApi replicates the CLI and SDK functionality, leveraging the same
configuration and providing a REST end point with Swagger/OpenAPI definition for
client generation

## Endpoints

### GET emissions/bylocation

This endpoint calculates the observed emission data by location for a specified
time period.

Location is a required parameter and is name of the data region for the
configured Cloud provider. If time period is not provided, it retrieves
available data until the current time.

```text
https://<server_name>/emissions/bylocation?location=useast&time=2022-01-01&toTime=2022-05-17
```

The response is an array of EmissionsData objects that contains the location,
time and the rating in g/kWh

  {
    "location":"eastus"
    "time":"2022-05-17T20:45:11.5092741+00:00",
    "rating":70
  },
  {
    "location":"westus"
    "time":"2022-05-17T20:45:11.5092741+00:00",
    "rating":64
  }
]
```

### GET emissions/bylocations/best

This endpoint calculates the best observed emission data by an array of
locations for a specified time period

Location is a required parameter and is an array of the names of the data region
for the configured Cloud provider. If time period is not provided, it retrieves
all the data until the current time.

```text
https://<server_name>/emissions/bylocations/best?locations=eastus&locations=westus&time=2022-01-01&toTime=2022-05-17

    "rating":70
  }
]
```

### GET emissions/forecasts/current

This endpoint fetches only the most recently generated forecast for all provided
locations. It uses the "dataStartAt" and "dataEndAt" parameters to scope the
forecasted data points (if available for those times). If no start or end time
boundaries are provided, the entire forecast dataset is used. The scoped data
points are used to calculate average carbon intensities of the
specified "windowSize" and the optimal carbon intensity window is
identified.

The forecast data represents what the data source predicts future
carbon intesity values to be, not actual measured emissions data (as future
values cannot be known).

This endpoint is useful for determining if there is a more carbon-optimal time
to use electicity predicted in the future.

Parameters:

1. `location`: This is a required parameter and is an array of the names of the
   data region for the configured Cloud provider.
2. `dataStartAt`: Start time boundary of the current forecast data points.
   Ignores current forecast data points before this time. Must be within the
   forecast data point timestamps. Defaults to the earliest time in the forecast
   data.
3. `dataEndAt`: End time boundary of the current forecast data points. Ignores
   current forecast data points after this time. Must be within the forecast
   data point timestamps. Defaults to the latest time in the forecast data. If
   neither `dataStartAt` nor `dataEndAt` are provided, all forecasted data
   points are used in calculating the optimal carbon intensity window.
4. `windowSize`: The estimated duration (in minutes) of the workload. Defaults
   to the duration of a single forecast data point.

```text
https://<server_name>/emissions/forecasts/current?location=northeurope&dataStartAt=2022-07-19T14:00:00Z&dataEndAt=2022-07-20T04:38:00Z&windowSize=10
```

The response is an array of forecasts (one per requested location) with their
optimal carbon intensity windows.

```json
[
  {
    "requestedAt": "2022-07-19T13:37:49+00:00",

      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### POST emissions/forecasts/batch

This endpoint takes a batch of requests for historical forecast data, fetches
them, and calculates the optimal carbon intensity windows for each
using the same parameters available to the '/emissions/forecasts/current'
endpoint.

This endpoint is useful for back-testing what one might have done in the past,
if they had access to the current forecast at the time.

Parameters:

1. requestedForecasts: Array of requested forecasts. Each requested forecast
   contains
   - `requestedAt`: This is a required parameter and is the historical time used
     to fetch the most recent forecast as of that time.
   - `location`: This is a required parameter and is the name of the data region
     for the configured Cloud provider.
   - `dataStartAt`: Start time boundary of the forecast data points. Ignores
     forecast data points before this time. Must be within the forecast data
     point timestamps. Defaults to the earliest time in the forecast data.
   - `dataEndAt`: End time boundary of the forecast data points. Ignores
     forecast data points after this time. Must be within the forecast data
     point timestamps. Defaults to the latest time in the forecast data.
   - `windowSize`: The estimated duration (in minutes) of the workload. Defaults
     to the duration of a single forecast data point

If neither `dataStartAt` nor `dataEndAt` are provided, all forecasted data
points are used in calculating the optimal carbon intensity window.

```json
[
  {
    "location": "eastus",
    "dataStartAt": "2022-06-01T14:00:00Z",

### GET emissions/average-carbon-intensity

This endpoint retrieves the measured carbon intensity data between the time
boundaries and calculates the average carbon intensity during that period.
Location is a required parameter and is the name of the data region for the
configured Cloud provider.

This endpoint is useful for reporting the measured carbon intensity for a
specific time period in a specific location.

Parameters:

1. `location`: This is a required parameter and is the string name of the data
   region for the configured Cloud provider.
2. `startTime`: The time at which the workload and corresponding carbon usage
   begins.
3. `endTime`: The time at which the workload and corresponding carbon usage
   ends.

```text
https://<server_name>/emissions/average-carbon-intensity?location=eastus&startTime=2022-07-19T14:00:00Z&endTime=2022-07-19T18:00:00Z
```

The response is a single object that contains the information about the request
and the average carbon intensity

```json
{
  "location": "eastus",
  "startTime": "2022-07-19T14:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2022-07-19T18:00:00Z",
  "carbonIntensity": 345.434
}
```

### POST emissions/average-carbon-intensity/batch

This endpoint takes an array of request objects, each with their own location
and time boundaries, and calculates the average carbon intensity for that
location and time period.

This endpoint only supports batching across a single location with different
time boundaries. If multiple locations are provided, an error is returned. For
each item in the request array, the application returns a corresponding object
containing the location, time boundaries, and average carbon intensity.

Parameters:

1. requestedCarbonIntensities: Array of requested carbon intensities. Each
   requested carbon intensity contains
   - `location`: This is a required parameter and is the name of the data region
     for the configured Cloud provider.
   - `startTime`: The time at which the workflow we are requesting carbon
     intensity for started.
   - `endTime`: The time at which the workflow we are requesting carbon
     intensity for ended.

```json
[
  {
    "location": "eastus",
    "startTime": "2022-05-01T14:00:00",
    "endTime": "2022-05-01T18:00:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "eastus",
    "startTime": "2022-06-01T14:00:00",
    "endTime": "2022-06-01T18:00:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "eastus",
    "startTime": "2022-07-01T14:00:00",
    "endTime": "2022-07-01T18:00:00"
  }
]
```

The response is an array of CarbonIntensityDTO objects which each have a
location, start time, end time, and the average carbon intensity over
that time period.

```json
[
  {
    "carbonIntensity": 32.935208333333335,
    "location": "eastus",
    "startTime": "2022-05-01T14:00:00-04:00",
    "endTime": "2022-05-01T18:00:00-04:00"
  },
  {
    "carbonIntensity": 89.18215277777779,
    "location": "eastus",
    "startTime": "2022-06-01T14:00:00-04:00",
    "endTime": "2022-06-01T18:00:00-04:00"
  },
  {
    "carbonIntensity": 10.416875,
    "location": "eastus",
    "startTime": "2022-07-01T14:00:00-04:00",
    "endTime": "2022-07-01T18:00:00-04:00"
  }
]
```

### GET /locations

This endpoint lists all the supported locations that the datasources potentially
can have access to. This information is coming from the `location-source/json`
files, that contain dictionaries in the form of `<A Location key name,
GeoCoordinates>`, for instance:

```json
{
  "eastus": {
    "Latitude": 37.3719,
    "Longitude": -79.8164,
    "Name": "eastus"
  },
  ...
  "switzerlandnorth":{
    "Latitude": 47.451542,
    "Longitude": 8.564572,
    "Name": "switzerlandnorth"
  }
}
```

`Emissions` and `Forecasts` endpoints would use the location's `key` name
returned by the `emssions/locations` endpoint.

**Note**: If there is **_a location key name_** collision while loading two or
more location json files and there is no `LocationDataSourcesConfiguration`
`Prefix` and/or `Delimiter` settings, the system would change the collision key
name by appending an underscore character and a sequence number to it (i.e.
`<key name>`**_\_seqnumber_**). For instance two location json files having
`swedencentral` as key, after loading, it would become:

```json
{
  "swedencentral": {
    "Latitude": 60.67488,
    "Longitude": 17.14127,
    "Name":"swedencentral"
  },
  ...
  "swedencentral_1": { // key collision. key renamed.
    "Latitude": null,
    "Longitude": null,
    "Name": "SE"
  },
  ...
}
```

If there is a third file with the same key name, it would be `swedencentral_2`
and so on. This information is not persisted, but now the user can make requests
using `swedencentral` and/or `swedencentral_1`. Also there are log **_warning_**
entries when this scenerario occurs to help the user to understand what key
renaming happened.

```sh
warn: Location key swedencentral from ... already exists. Creating new key.
...
warn: New key swedencentral_1 generated from swedencentral
CarbonAware.LocationSources.LocationSource: Warning: New key swedencentral_1 generated from swedencentral
```

## Error Handling

The WebAPI leveraged the
[.Net controller filter pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-8.0)
to ensure that all requests respond with a consistent JSON schema.

![.Net controller filter pipeline image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters/_static/filter-pipeline-2.png?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

Controllers are responsible for managing the "Success" responses. If an error
occurs in the WebAPI code and an unhandled exception is thrown, the
[custom Exception Filter](./Filters/HttpResponseExceptionFilter.cs) will manage
converting that exception into the appropriate JSON response. NOTE: The
Exception Filter is only used for unhandled exceptions. If the exception is
caught and handled by the WebAPI code, the controller will continue to manage
the response.

The .Net framework will automatically respond to validation errors with a
[ValidationProblemDetails](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.validationproblemdetails?view=aspnetcore-8.0)
object. Using the Exception Filter class enables the WebAPI to consistently
respond with the `ValidationProblemDetails` error schema in all error cases and
take advantage of error handling automatically provided by the framework.

## Autogenerate WebAPI

Using the following steps, it is possible to get the CarbonAware WebApi OpenAPI
specification

1. Make sure the current directory is `<path to project root>/src/`

    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    cd CarbonAware.WebApi/src
    dotnet tool restore
    dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
    dotnet tool run swagger tofile --output ./wwwroot/api/v1/swagger.yaml --yaml bin/Release/net8.0/CarbonAware.WebApi.dll v1
    ```
1. The `CarbonAware.WebApi/src/wwwroot/api/v1/swagger.yaml` file contains the supported 
   OpenApi specification.
1. Use for instance [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io) to see and try 
   the endpoint routes.

## Data Sources

### WattTime

#### WattTime Locations

Each WattTime emissions data point is associated with a particular named
balancing authority. For transparency, this value is also used in
`EmissionsData` response objects. It is not overwritten to match the named
datacenter provided by any request.

> "A balancing authority ensures, in real time, that power system demand and
> supply are finely balanced. This balance is needed to maintain the safe and
> reliable operation of the power system. If demand and supply fall out of
> balance, local or even wide-area blackouts can result."
>
> See [this post](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27152) on
> balancing authories from the EIA to learn more.

#### WattTime Exception Handling

If WattTime responds with a 4XX or 5XX status code the WattTime Data Source will
forward the response code and message back to the caller. Refer to the
[current WattTime documentation](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/)
for the most up-to-date information about possible error codes.

#### Example Emissions Call Using WattTime

The swimlanes diagram below follows an example request for emissions data using
WattTime as the data source provider. In this diagram, the _Client_ is a user of
the SDK and the _WattTimeService_ is the [WattTime](https://www.wattime.org)
API.

![webapi to watttime flow diagram](../images/webapi-swimlanes.png)

### ElectricityMaps

#### ElectricityMaps Locations

Each ElectricityMaps emissions data point is associated with a particular named
zone. While the ElectricityMaps endpoint supports calling with lat/long
geoposition as well, the result will always be a corresponding zone name. They
provide a
[route on their API](https://static.electricitymaps.com/api/docs/index.html#zones)
which can be queried to list all the zone names you have access to given your
token

#### ElectricityMaps Exception Handling

If ElectricityMaps responds with a 4XX or 5XX status code the ElectricityMaps
Data Source will forward the response code and message back to the caller. Refer
to the
[ElectricityMapsHttpClientException](../src/CarbonAware.DataSources/CarbonAware.DataSources.ElectricityMaps/src/Client/ElectricityMapsClientHttpException.cs)
class for documentation on expected error codes.

### ElectricityMapsFree

#### Locations

Each ElectricityMapsFree emissions data point is associated with a particular
named country code. While the ElectricityMapsFree endpoint supports calling with
lat/long geoposition as well, the result will always be a corresponding country
code.
They provide a
[route on their parent API (ElectricityMaps)](https://static.electricitymaps.com/api/docs/index.html#zones)
which can be queried to list all the country codes you have access to given your
token.

#### Exception Handling

If ElectricityMapsFree responds with a 4XX or 5XX status code the
ElectricityMapsFree Data Source will forward the response code and message back
to the caller. Refer to the
[ElectricityMapsFreeHttpClientException](../src/CarbonAware.DataSources/CarbonAware.DataSources.ElectricityMapsFree/src/Client/ElectricityMapsFreeClientHttpException.cs)
class for documentation on expected error codes.
