# Selecting a Data Source

The Carbon Aware SDK includes access to various data sources of carbon aware
data, including WattTime, ElectricityMaps, and a custom
JSON source. These matrices are an attempt to track what features of the Carbon
Aware SDK are enabled for which data sources.

## Type of Data Sources and Configuration

In the CarbonAware SDK configuration, you can set what data source to use as the
`EmissionsDataSource` and the `ForecastDataSource`. There are also certain
configuration fields that must be set in order to access the raw data.

| Type                          | WattTime  | ElectricityMaps                                                                    | JSON     |
|-------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Is Emissions DataSource       | &#9989;   | &#9989;                                                                            | &#9989;  |
| Is Forecast DataSource        | &#9989;   | &#9989;                                                                            | &#10060; |

| Can Use Custom Data           | &#10060;  | &#10060;                                                                           | &#9989;  |
| Supports Trial + Full Account | &#9989;   | &#9989; | N/A      |

## Data Source Methods Available

Not all data sources support all the routes provided in the interfaces
(`IEmissionsDataSource`/`IForecastDataSource`).

## Location Coverage

Different data sources provide both different features (as outlined above) but
also coverage of different geographic areas. It's important to note that each
data source may have different region names, which are handled through the
location config.

- For `WattTime`, see their
  [interactive coverage map](https://www.watttime.org/explorer) to find the
  relevant zone.
- For `ElectricityMaps`, see their
  [live map app](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map)
  to find the relevant zone and see current data coming in or their
  [zone list](https://api.electricitymap.org/v3/zones) endpoint to find the relevant
  zones.
