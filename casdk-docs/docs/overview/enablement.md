## 1. What Carbon Aware SDK Provide You?

Carbon Aware SDK helps you reduce the carbon footprint of your application by
analyzing the times and locations where it is most carbon-efficient.
There are several ways to consume CarbonAware data for your use case. Each
approach surfaces the same data for the same call (e.g. the CLI should not give
you different data than the WebAPI for the same query). We provide a number of
different endpoints to provide the most flexibility to integrate to your
environment:

* CLI  
You can run the application using the [CLI](/src/CarbonAware.CLI) and refer
  to more documentation [here](../tutorial-basics/carbon-aware-cli.md).  

* WebAPI  
You can build a container containing the [WebAPI](/src/CarbonAware.WebApi)
  and connect via REST requests and refer to more documentation
  [here](../tutorial-basics/carbon-aware-webapi.md).

* SDK  
You can reference the [Carbon Aware C# Library](/src/GSF.CarbonAware) in your
  projects and make use of its functionalities and features.

### Use cases

CarbonAwareSDK has been embraced by the industry leaders across the globe. Here
we show some examples of the [use case](./adopters.md).

## 2. How to use Carbon Aware SDK?

### 2.1 Pre-requisites

#### Data sources

We support various data sources of carbon aware data:

* [WattTime](https://www.watttime.org/)
* [ElectricityMaps](https://www.electricitymaps.com/)
* [ElectricityMapsFree](https://www.co2signal.com/)
* JSON file

There are a few constraints to select data sources to some functions of
CarbonAwareSDK. You can also visit the [Selecting a Data Source](../tutorial-extras/selecting-a-data-source.md)
guide for further information on data sources options, and [Data Sources](../architecture/data-sources.md)
for detailed architecture decisions around integrating different data
providers into the carbon aware SDK.

#### System requirement

* Command Line Interface (CLI)
  * .NET 8.0
  * Alternatively:
    * Docker
    * VSCode and its [Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
* WebAPI  
  * Docker
  * VSCode and its [Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### 2.2 CLI

#### Set up

The CLI can either be run locally with `.NET` or in a container, e.g. using
VSCode Remote Containers (Dev Container). To run locally:

1. Clone CarbonAwareSDK to your environment: `git clone https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git`
2. Change directory to: `cd carbon-aware-sdk/src/CarbonAware.CLI/src`
3. If you have a WattTime account registered (or other data source) - you will
   need to configure the application to use them. By default the SDK will use a
   pre-generated JSON file with random data. This random data is meant to make
   it easier to get started with the SDK and doesn't represent actual Carbon
   data. To configure the application, you will need to set up specific
   environment variables or modify `appsettings.json` inside of
   `src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src` directory. Detailed information on configuration
   can be found in the [overview.md](overview.md) file.

   Otherwise, you can follow an example configuration below (export these
   environment variables in the Terminal):

   ```bash
   export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__Type="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__username="<YOUR_WATTTIME_USERNAME>"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__password="<YOUR_WATTTIME_PASSWORD>"
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__Type="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APITokenHeader="auth-token"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APIToken="<YOUR_ELECTRICITYMAPS_TOKEN>"
   ```

   or

   ```bash
    export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="ElectricityMapsFree"
    export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMapsFree__Type="ElectricityMapsFree"
    export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMapsFree__token="<CO2SIGNAL_TOKEN>"
   ```

4. Run the CLI using `dotnet run`

The CLI will ask you to at minimum provide a `--location (-l)` parameter.

#### Usage

Calling the SDK via CLI
To run the CLI, simply call `dotnet run` and provide it with any parameters. If
you fail to pass any parameters, a help screen will be printed out with possible
parameters and short explanations.

To get a list of all locations supported, you can use the Locations API,
referenced in `src/CarbonAware.CLI/src/Commands/Location`
and the command `.\caw locations`.
Note that you have to configure `LocationDataSourcesConfiguration`
into `appsettings.json` before running the command.

Expected output:

```JSON
{
  "eastus": {
    "Latitude": 37.3719,
    "Longitude": -79.8164,
    "Name": "eastus"
  },
  ...
  "switzerlandnorth":{
    "Latitude": 47.451542,
    "Longitude": 8.564572,
    "Name": "switzerlandnorth"
  },
  ...
}
```

For example, to get emissions in the `eastus` and `uksouth` region between
`2022-08-23 at 11:15am` and `2022-08-23 at 11:20am`, run:
`dotnet run emissions -l eastus,uksouth -s 2022-08-23T11:15 -e 2022-08-23T11:20`

Expected output:

```JSON
[
  {
    "Location": "PJM_ROANOKE",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:20:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 567.44405487,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "PJM_ROANOKE",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:15:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 564.72250065,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:20:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 422.74808884000004,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T11:15:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 422.74808884000004,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  },
]
```

To get the best time and location from a list of locations and a specified time
window, use the `--best` flag. E.g. to get the best time and location in a 24
hour window on the 23rd of August in the regions: `eastus`, `westus`,
`westus3`,`uksouth`, run the command:

```bash
dotnet run -l eastus,westus,westus3,uksouth -s 2022-08-23T00:00 -e 2022-08-23T23:59 --best
```

Expected output:

```JSON
[
  {
    "Location": "UK",
    "Time": "2022-08-23T08:50:00+00:00",
    "Rating": 384.64632976,
    "Duration": "00:05:00"
  }
]
```

### 2.3 WebAPI

#### Setup

##### Deploying with Container

First we need to set up the GitHub repository
[https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git):

1. `git clone https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk.git`
2. Change directory into the repository: `cd carbon-aware-sdk`
3. Open VSCode: `code .`
4. Open VSCode Command Palette: (Linux/Windows: `ctrl + shift + P`, MacOS:
   `cmd + shift + P`), and run the command:
   * `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`
5. If you have a WattTime account registered (or other data source) - you will
   need to configure the application to use them. By default the SDK will use a
   pre-generated JSON file with random data. To configure the application, you
   will need to set up specific environment variables or modify
   `appsettings.json` inside of `src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src` directory. Detailed
   information on configuration can be found in the [overview.md](overview.md)
   file.

   Otherwise, you can follow an example configuration below (export these
   environment variables in the Terminal):

   ```bash
   export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__Type="WattTime"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__username="<YOUR_WATTTIME_USERNAME>"
   export DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__password="<YOUR_WATTTIME_PASSWORD>"
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   export DataSources__ForecastDataSource="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__Type="ElectricityMaps"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APITokenHeader="auth-token"
   export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMaps__APIToken="<YOUR_ELECTRICITYMAPS_TOKEN>"
   ```

   or

   ```bash
    export DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="ElectricityMapsFree"
    export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMapsFree__Type="ElectricityMapsFree"
    export DataSources__Configurations__ElectricityMapsFree__token="<CO2SIGNAL_TOKEN>"
   ```

6. In the VSCode Terminal:
7. Change directory to: `cd src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src`
8. And run the application using: `dotnet run`
9. By default, it will be hosted on `localhost:5073`

##### Deploy Web API on Kubernetes with Helm

You can deploy Web API as a Kubernetes application via Helm. GSF provides a
chart as an OCI container, so you have to use Helm v3.8.0 or later.

Following command creates `carbon-aware-sdk` namespace and deploys Web API into
it with specified `values.yaml`.

```bash
helm install casdk -n carbon-aware-sdk --create-namespace oci://ghcr.io/green-software-foundation/charts/carbon-aware-sdk --values values.yaml
```

`values.yaml` should contain `appsettings.json` which would be used in Web API
at least. It should include data source definitions and their credentials. It
would be stored as `Secret` resource.

```yaml
appsettings: |-
  {
    "DataSources": {
      "EmissionsDataSource": "WattTime",
      "ForecastDataSource": "WattTime",
      "Configurations": {
        "WattTime": {
          "Type": "WattTime",
          "Username": "username",
          "Password": "password",
          "BaseURL": "https://api2.watttime.org/v2/"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Also you can include following configuration into `values.yaml`.

```yaml
# Number of replicas
replicaCount: 1

  repository: ghcr.io/green-software-foundation/carbon-aware-sdk
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # You can set specified tag (equivalent with the SDK version in here)

          "BaseURL": "https://api.electricitymap.org/v3/"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

The video in below is demonstration to install Carbon Aware SDK via Helm. Note
that installing the SDK from local directory
( ~/github-forked/carbon-aware-sdk/helm-chart ), not an OCI container.

[!Demonstration to intall Carbon Aware SDK from local with Helm](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/assets/7421132/b09d8ab1-642b-442a-882f-abc802153070)

#### Usage

##### Calling the Web API via command line

Prerequisites:

* `curl` or other tool that allows making HTTP requests (e.g. `wget`)
* Recommended: `jq` for parsing JSON output: [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

With the API running on `localhost:5073`, we can make HTTP requests to its
endpoints, full endpoint description can be found [here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src/README.md)

To get a list of all locations supported, you can use the Locations API endpoint
`/locations` referenced in
`src/CarbonAware.WebApi/src/Controllers/LocationsController.cs`.
Note that you have to configure `LocationDataSourcesConfiguration`
into `appsettings.json` before launching WebAPI, otherwise WebAPI returns
HTTP 204 (No Content).

Expected Output:

```JSON
{
  "eastus": {
    "Latitude": 37.3719,
    "Longitude": -79.8164,
    "Name": "eastus"
  },
  ...
  "switzerlandnorth":{
    "Latitude": 47.451542,
    "Longitude": 8.564572,
    "Name": "switzerlandnorth"
  }
}
```

##### Calling the `/emissions/bylocation` endpoint

In console, we can run the below command, to request data for a single location
in a particular timeframe:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5073/emissions/bylocation?location=westus&time=2022-08-23T14%3A00&toTime=2022-08-23T14%3A30" | jq
```

Note that region names in this example (e.g. `westus`) are defined in
[azure-regions.json](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/data/location-sources/azure-regions.json).
AWS region is also available in [aws-regions.json](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/src/data/data-files/aws-regions.json).

You can omit the `| jq` to get the JSON data raw and unparsed. This is a request
for data in the `westus` region from the date `2022-08-23 at 14:00` to
`2022-08-23 at 14:30`. (Note: semicolons `:` are encoded as `%3A` in URLs).

The sample data output should be:

```JSON
[
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:30:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.07741416000005,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:25:00+00:00",
    "rating": 438.62382179,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:20:00+00:00",
    "rating": 438.62382179,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:15:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.53100653,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:10:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.98459890000004,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:05:00+00:00",
    "rating": 456.31392422000005,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T14:00:00+00:00",
    "rating": 439.98459890000004,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  },
  {
    "location": "CAISO_NORTH",
    "time": "2022-08-23T13:55:00+00:00",
    "rating": 445.42770734000004,
    "duration": "00:05:00"
  }
]
```

#### Calling the Web API via client libraries

The SDK can work with libraries for up to 50 languages generated with the
[Open API Generator (Swagger)](https://openapi-generator.tech/). This guide will
provide a tutorial to generating clients for java, Python, JavaScript, .NET and
GoLang. There is also a walkthrough of an example Python script interacting with
the SDK.

### 2.4 Configurations

This project uses the dotnet standard
[Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration)
mechanism, which allows the user to configure their environment variables in a
unified view while making use of different configuration sources. Review the
link to understand more about the `IConfiguration` type.

The WebAPI project uses standard configuration sources provided by
[ASPNetCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/).
Please review this link to understand how configuration is loaded and the
priority of that configuration.

Please note that configuration is hierarchical. The last configuration source
loaded that contains a configuration value will be the value that's used. This
means that if the same configuration value is found in both `appsettings.json`
and as an environment variable, the value from the environment variable will be
the value that's applied.

See [configuration.md](../tutorial-extras/configuration.md) for details about how to
configure specific components of the application.

#### Environment variables

When adding values via environment variables, we recommend that you use the
double underscore form, rather than the colon form. Colons won't work in
non-windows environment. For example:

```bash
  DataSources__EmissionsDataSource="WattTime"
```

Note that double underscores are used to represent dotted notation or child
elements that you see in the JSON below. For example, to set proxy information
using environment variables, you'd do this:

```bash
  DataSources__Configurations__WattTime__UseProxy
```

#### Local project settings

For local-only settings you can use environment variables,
[the Secret Manager tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?tabs=windows#secret-manager)
, or an untracked Development appsettings file to override the default project
settings.

To use the settings file, rename a copy of the template called
`appsettings.Development.json.template` to `appsettings.Development.json` and
remove the first line of (invalid) comments. Then update any settings according
to your preferences.

> Wherever possible, the projects leverage the
> [default .NET configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?#default-application-configuration-sources)
> expectations. Thus, they can be configured using any file matching the format:
> `appsettings.<ENV>.json`. Where `<ENV>` is the value of the
> `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. By convention projects tend to
> use the provided HostEnvironment constants `Development`, `Staging`, and
> `Production`.
