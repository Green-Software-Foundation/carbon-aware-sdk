## Summary Steps

For the following:

"Member and "Contributor" refer to the GSF member looking to make a feature
contribution. "Chair" refers to the Chair, Co-Chair or other accountable
authority within GSF.

1. Submit a Public Issue using the Issue Template
2. The Issue will be looked at by a Chair and approved.
3. The Contributor is assigned an "Approved Reviewer" who will help shepherd the
   feature into the GSF Repository
4. Fork `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev` into a member repository,
   `member/carbon-aware-sdk/dev`
5. Open a Draft PR from `member/dev` into `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev` using the
   PR Template
6. Once development is over, the Approved Reviewer pushes the PR into the "Ready
   for Review" state
7. If the Chair accepts the PR, it merges into `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev`

## Public Issues

All contributions to the GSF are tracked through public issues. Please make a
public issue and fill out details on the proposed feature contribution. The
issue serves as a commitment by the contributor to developing the feature.

The Issue is **not** a feature request, but tracks expected feature work. Please
do **not** open an issue to request features.
